# Exercise 1

## Java Tools

I decided to look into java tools for exercise 1. For linting some tools include Checkstyle,
Findbugs, PMD and SonarQube. Of these I have used sonarqube previously, and it was quite a good
experience. It is what I would use in a new java project.

For testing popular frameworks include JUnit for unit testing and Mockito for mocking classes. A 
mocking framework sounds like a foreign consept and wuite interesting. I have not used any testing
frameworks for java. JUnit seems to be quite prevalent.

For building the two overwhelmingly most popular tools are Maven and Gradle. Of these I would
probably use Gradle because I have used it before and the xml configuration files from Maven look
scary.

## CI Tools

Options beside Jenkins and Github Actions for CI include Gitlab CI, CircleCI, Bamboo and Buddy. I 
have used Gitlab pipelines in school and at work so it would be an obvious choice for a project. I 
have heard advertisements from CircleCI but Bamboo and Buddy were completetly unknown to me. A new
tool would be interesting to learn.

## Self hosted vs Cloud

For gitlab I would probably set up a local instance because I have some experience setting up gitlab
runners for CI jobs. For the other tools cloud would probably be the better option so that I didn't
have to do so much setup.
